Flask-Classy
=============

.. module:: flask.ext.classy

Flask-Classy is an extension that adds class-based views to Flask.
But why?

I ❤ Flask. Like a lot. But sometimes projects get a little big
and I need some way of managing and organizing all the different
pieces. I know what you're saying: "But what about Blueprints?"

You're right. Blueprints are pretty awesome. But I found that they
aren't always enough to encapsulate a specific context the way I
need. What I wanted, no what I *needed* was to be able to group
my views into relevant classes each with their own context and
behavior. It's also made testing really nifty too.

"OK, I see your point. But can't I just use the base classes in
``flask.views`` to do that?"

Well, yes and no. While ``flask.views.MethodView`` does
provide some of the functionality of ``flask.ext.classy.FlaskView``
it doesn't quite complete the picture by supporting methods that
aren't part of the typical CRUD operations for a given resource, or
make it easy for me to override the route rules for particular view.
And while ``flask.views.View`` does add some context, it requires
a class for each view instead of letting me group very similar
views for the same resource into a single class.

"But my projects aren't that big. Can Flask-Classy do
anything else for me besides making a big project easier to manage?"

Why yes. It does help a bit with one other thing.

`Flask-Classy` will automatically generate routes based on the methods
in your views, and makes it super simple to override those routes
using Flask's familiar decorator syntax.

Installation
------------

Install the extension with::

    $ pip install flask-classy

or if you're kickin' it old-school::
    
    $ easy_install flask-classy

Let's see how it works
----------------------

If you're like me, you probably get a better idea of how to use something
when you see it being used. Let's go ahead and create a little app to
see how Flask-Classy works::

    from flask import Flask
    from flask.ext.classy import FlaskView

    # we'll make a list to hold some quotes for our app
    quotes = [
        "A noble spirit embiggens the smallest man! ~ Jebediah Springfield",
        "If there is a way to do it better... find it. ~ Thomas Edison",
        "No one knows what he can do till he tries. ~ Publilius Syrus"
    ]

    app = Flask(__name__)

    class QuotesView(FlaskView):
        def index(self):
            return "<br>".join(quotes)

    QuotesView.register(app)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run()

Run this app and open your web browser to: http://localhost:5000/quotes/

As you can see, it returns the list of quotes. But what if we just wanted
one quote? What would we do then?

::

    class QuotesView(FlaskView):
        def index(self):
            ...

        def get(self, id):
            id = int(id)
            if id < len(quotes) - 1:
                return quotes[id]
            else:
                return "Not Found", 404

Now direct your browser to: http://localhost:5000/quotes/1/ and you should
see the very poignant quote from the esteemed Mr. Edison.

That's cool and all, but what if we just wanted a random quote? What then?
Let's add a random view to our FlaskView::

    from random import choice

::

    class QuotesView(FlaskView):
        def index(self):
            ...

        def get(self, id):
            ...

        def random(self):
            return choice(quotes)

And point your browser to: http://localhost:5000/quotes/random/ and see
that a random quote is returned each time. Voilà!

So by now you must be keenly aware of the fact that you have not defined a
single route, but yet routing is obviously taking place. "Is this voodoo?"
you ask?

Not at all. Flask-Classy will automatically create routes for any method
in a FlaskView that doesn't begin with an underscore character.
You can still define your own routes of course, and we'll look at that next.

Using custom routes
-------------------

So let's pretend that `/quotes/random/` is just too unsightly and we must
fix it to be something more spectacular forthwith. In a moment of blind
inspiration we decide that getting a random quote is on par with receiving
a rasher of your favorite porcine delicacy. The new url should be `/quotes/word_bacon/`
so that everyone knows what a treat they are in for.

::

    from flask.ext.classy import FlaskView, route

::

    class QuotesView(FlaskView):
        def index(self):
            ...

        def get(self, id):
            ...

        @route('/word_bacon/') #<--- Adding route
        def random(self):
            return choice(quotes)

Load up http://localhost/quotes/word_bacon/ in your browser and behold
your latest achievement.

The route decorator takes exactly the same parameters as Flask's `app.route`
decorator, so you should feel right at home adding custom routes to any
views you create.

.. note::
    If you want to use other decorators with your views, you'll need to
    make sure that the ``@route`` decorators are last (closest to the
    method definition). I'm working on a way to change this requirement
    in a future release.

So far, all of our urls have been prefixed by that `/quotes` bit and you
have probably deduced that it was derived from the name of your FlaskView
instance (minus the "View" suffix, of course.) "That's all well and good,"
you're saying, "but how do I change that? What if I want my views at the
root?" Well, person, I have an answer for you.

Customizing the Route Base
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are 2 ways to customize the base route of a `FlaskView`. (Well
technically there are 3 if you count changing the name of the class
but that's hardly a reasonable way to go about it.)

Method 1:
*********

The first method simply requires you to set a `route_base` attribute on
your `FlaskView`. Suppose we wanted to make our QuotesView handle the
root of the web application::

    class QuotesView(FlaskView):
        route_base = '/'

        def index(self):
            ...

        def get(self, id):
            ...

        @route('/word_bacon/')
        def random(self):
            ...

Method 2:
*********

The second method is perfect for when you're using app factories, and
you need to be able to specify different base routes for different apps.
You can specify the route when you register the class with the Flask app
instance::

    QuotesView.register(app, route_base='/')

The second method will always override the first, so you can use method
one, and override it with method two if needed. Sweet!

Using multiple routes for a single view
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What happens when you need to apply more than one route to a specific view
(for what it's worth, Flask core developer Armin Ronacher `says doing that is
a bad idea <http://stackoverflow.com/a/7876088/105987>`_). But since you're so
determined let's see how to do that anyway.

So let's say you add the following routes to one of your views::

    class QuotesView(FlaskView):
        route_base = '/'

        @route('/quote/<id>')
        @route('/quote/show/<id>')
        def show_quote(self, id):
            ...

That would end up generating the following 2 routes:

============ ================================
**rule**     /quote/<id>
**endpoint** QuotesView:show_quote_1
**method**   GET
============ ================================

============ ================================
**rule**     /quote/show/<id>
**endpoint** QuotesView:show_quote_0
**method**   GET
============ ================================

"Oh weird! What's with all the _0 and _1 stuff?" you ask in disgust. Well
first I want to know how you managed to pronounce _0. But really the reason
is that since there is more than one route, an index is added to prevent an
endpoint collision. This differs from the default behavior of `Flask`, which
allows you to create collisions.

Specify your own damn endpoint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So you don't like the nifty indexing trick? Well fine then. I guess you can
go ahead and specify your own endpoint if you like but that's only because I
like you.

::

    class QuotesView(FlaskView):
        route_base = '/'

        @route('/quote/<id>', endpoint='show_quote')
        @route('/quote/show/<id>')
        def show_quote(self, id):
            ...

Will generate the following routes:

============ ================================
**rule**     /quote/<id>
**endpoint** show_quote
**method**   GET
============ ================================

============ ================================
**rule**     /quote/show/<id>
**endpoint** QuotesView:show_quote_0
**method**   GET
============ ================================

Special method names
--------------------

So I guess I have to break the narrative a bit here so I can take some
time to talk about `Flask-Classy`'s special method names.

Here's the thing. `FlaskView` is smart. No, not solving differential
equations smart, but let's just say it knows how to put the round peg
in the round hole. When you register a `FlaskView` with an app,
`FlaskView` will look for special methods in your class. Why? Because
I care. I know that sometimes you just want things to just *work* and
not have to think about it. Let's look at `FlaskView`'s very special
method names:

**index**
    Woah... you've seen this one before! Remember way back at the
    beginning? Oh nevermind. So *index* is generally used for home pages
    and lists of resources. The automatically generated route is:

    ============ ================================
    **rule**     /
    **endpoint** <class name>:index
    **method**   GET
    ============ ================================

**get**
    Another old familiar friend, `get` is usually used to retrieve a
    specific resource. The automatically generated route is:

    ============ ================================
    **rule**     /<id>
    **endpoint** <class name>:get
    **method**   GET
    ============ ================================

**post**
    This method is generally used for creating new instances of a resource
    but can really be used to handle any posted data you want. The
    automatically generated route is:

    ============ ================================
    **rule**     /
    **endpoint** <class name>:post
    **method**   POST
    ============ ================================

**put**
    For those of us using REST this one is really helpful. It's generally
    used to update a specific resource. The automatically generated route
    is:

    ============ ================================
    **rule**     /<id>
    **endpoint** <class name>:put
    **method**   PUT
    ============ ================================

**patch**
    Similar to `put`, `patch` is used for updating a resource. Unlike `put`
    however you only send the parts of the resource you want changed,
    instead of doing a complete replacement of the resource. The automatically
    generated route is:

    ============ ================================
    **rule**     /<id>
    **endpoint** <class name>:patch
    **method**   PATCH
    ============ ================================

**delete**
    More RESTfulness. It's the most self explanatory of all the RESTful
    methods, and it's commonly used to destroy a specific resource. The
    automatically generated route is:

    ============ ================================
    **rule**     /<id>
    **endpoint** <class name>:delete
    **method**   DELETE
    ============ ================================


Your own methods (they're special too!)
---------------------------------------

Let's talk about how you can add your own methods (like we did with
`random` back in the day, remember? Good times.) If you add your own
methods `FlaskView` will detect them during registration and register
routes for them, whether you've gone and defined your own, or you just
want to let `FlaskView` do it's thing. By default, `FlaskView` will
create a route that is the same as the method name. So if you define a
view method in your `FlaskView` like this::

    class SomeView(FlaskView):
        route_base = "root"

        def my_view(self):
            return "Check out my view!"

`FlaskView` will generate a route like this:

============ ================================
**rule**      /some/my_view/
**endpoint**  SomeView:my_view
**method**    GET
============ ================================

"That's fine." you say. "But what if I have a view method with some
parameters?" Well `FlaskView` will try to take care of that for you
too. If you were to define another view like this::

    class AnotherView(FlaskView):
        route_base = "home"

        def this_view(self, arg1, arg2):
            return "Args: %s, %s" % (arg1, arg2,)

`FlaskView` would generate a route like this:

============ ================================
**rule**     /home/this_view/<arg1>/<arg2>
**endpoint** AnotherView:this_view
**method**   GET
============ ================================

.. note::
    One important thing to note, is that `FlaskView` does not type your
    parameters, so if you want or need them you'll need to define the
    route yourself using the `@route` decorator.


Wrapping Views
--------------

Hey, remember that time when you made that big 'ol `Flask` app and then
had those ``@app.before_reqeust`` and ``@app.after_request``
decorated methods? Remember how you only wanted some of them to run for
certain views so you had all those ``if view == the_one_I_care_about:``
statements and stuff?

**Yuck.**

I've been there too, and I think you might like how `Flask-Classy`
addresses this very touchy issue. ``FlaskView`` will look for wrapper
methods when your request is being processed so that you can create more
fine grained "before and after" processing methods.

Wrap all the views in a FlaskView
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So there you are, eating a delicious Strawberry Frosted Pop Tart one
morning, thinking about the awesome `Flask-Classy` app you deployed the
night before during one of your late night hackathons and it hits you:

*"Tracking! I need to track those widgets!"*

No doubt it's an inspired thought, but in this case it was a tragic
oversight. You realize now how lucky it was that you chose to use
`Flask-Classy` because adding tracking is going to be a snap::

    from flask.ext.classy import FlaskView
    from made_up_tracking import track_it

    class WidgetsView(FlaskView):

        def before_request(self, name):
            track_it("something is happening to a widget")

        def after_request(self, name, response):
            track_it("something happened to a widget")
            return response

        def post(self):
            ...

        def get(self, id):
            ...

Whew. Crisis averted, am I right? So you go about your day and at lunch time
you hit your favorite Bacon Sandwich place and start daydreaming about your
life as a rockstar `Flask-Classy` consultant when suddenly:

*"I really only care about when widgets are created and retrieved!"*

Wrap only specific views
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yep, you've got a granularity problem. Not to worry though because
`Flask-Classy` is happy to let you know that it has *smart* wrapper methods
too. Let's say for example you wanted to run something before the ``index`` view
runs? Just create a method called ``before_index`` and `Flask-Classy` will make
sure it gets run only before that view. (as you have guessed by now,
``after_index`` will be run only after the index view).

::

    from flask.ext.classy import FlaskView
    from made_up_tracking import track_it

    class WidgetsView(FlaskView):

        # Will be run before the 'get' view
        def before_get(self):
            track_it("a widget is being accessed")

        # Will be run before the 'post' view
        def after_post(self, response):
            track_it("a widget was created")
            return response

        def post(self):
            ...

        def get(self, id):
            ...

The View Wrappin' Method List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just to be certain, let's go ahead and review the methods you can write to
wrap your views:

**before_request(self, name, *args, *kwargs)**
    Will be called before any view in this ``FlaskView`` is called.

    :name:       The name of the view that's about to be called.


    :\*args:     Any arguments that will be passed to the view.


    :\*\*kwargs: Any keyword arguments that will be passed to the view.


**before_<view_method>(self, *args, **kwargs)**
    Will be called before the view specified <view_method> is called.

    :\*args:     Any arguments that will be passed to the view.


    :\*\*kwargs: Any keyword arguments that will be passed to the view.


**after_request(self, name, response)**
    Will be called after any view in this ``FlaskView`` is called. You must
    return either the passed in response or a new response.

    :name:       The name of the view that was called.


    :resposne:   The response produced after calling the view.


**after_<view_method>(self, response)**
    Will be called after the <view_method> is called. You must return either
    the passed in response or a new response.

    :resposne:   The response produced after calling the view.


Order of Wrapped Method Execution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wrapper methods are called in the same order every time. "How predictable."
you're thinking. (You're starting to sound like my ex, sheesh.) I prefer the
term *reliable*.

1. Any method registered with ``@app.before_request``
2. FlaskView's ``before_request`` method
3. FlaskView's ``before_<view_method>`` method
4. The actual view method
5. FlaskView's ``after_<view_method>`` method
6. FlaskView's ``after_request`` method
7. Any method registered with ``@app.after_request``

Subdomains (getting advanced 'n stuff)
--------------------------------------

By now, you've built a few hundred `Flask` apps using `Flask-Classy`
and you probably think you're an expert. But not until you've tried
the snazzy `Subdomains` feature my friend.

Flask-Classy allows you to specify a subdomain to be used when
registering routes for your FlaskViews. While the usefulness of this
feature is probably apparent to many of you, let's go ahead and take a
look at one of the many facilitative use cases.

Suppose you've got a sweet api you're porting over from a legacy app
and in the migration you want to clean things up a bit and start using
a subdomain like ``api.socool.biz`` instead of the old way of accessing
it using ``api`` at the root of the path like ``socool.biz/api``. The
only catch, of course, is that you have api clients still using that
old path based method. What is a hard working developer like you to do?

Thanks to `Flask` and `Flask-Classy` you have some options. There are two
easy ways you can choose from to tell `Flask-Classy` which subdomains your
``FlaskView`` should respond to.

Let's see both methods so you can choose which one works best for your
application.

The Define-During-Registration Method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Probably the most flexible method, you can define which subdomains you
want to support at the same time you're registering your views::

    # views.py

    from flask.ext.classy import FlaskView

    class CoolApiView(FlaskView):

        def index(self):
            return "API stuff"

::

    # main.py

    from flask import Flask
    from views import CoolApiView

    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.config['SERVER_NAME'] = 'socool.biz'

    # This one matches urls like: http://socool.biz/api/...
    CoolApiView.register(app, route_base='/api/')

    # This one matches urls like: http://api.socool.biz/...
    CoolApiView.register(app, route_base='/', subdomain='api')

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        app.run()

The Explicit-Define-In-The-FlaskView Method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using this method, you can explicitly define a subdomain as an attribute of
the ``FlaskView`` subclass::

    # views.py

    from flask.ext.classy import FlaskView

    class CoolApiView(FlaskView):
        subdomain = "api"

        def index(self):
            return "API Stuff"

::

    # main.py

    from flask import Flask
    from views import CoolApiView

    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.config['SERVER_NAME'] = 'socool.biz'

    # This one matches urls like: http://socool.biz/api/...
    CoolApiView.register(app, route_base='/api/', subdomain='')

    # This one matches urls like: http://api.socool.biz/...
    CoolApiView.register(app, route_base="/")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        app.run()

As you can see here, specifying the subdomain to the register method will
override the explicit subdomain attribute set inside the class.
