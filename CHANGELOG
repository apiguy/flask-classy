    Version 0.6

    - **Breaking Changes**
        * Classmethods are filtered out when determining which methods
          should be routeable.

    - Features
        * FlaskViews now support a "decorators" attribute which takes a list
          of decorators to apply to every method in that view.
        * The route_base now supports arguments.
        (Thanks to Philip Schleihauf)



    - Bugfixes
        * Fixed a bug that prevented Flask-Classy from generating routes for
          methods that had used a decorator but did not also use the @route
          decorator.
          (Thanks to Shuhao Wu for reporting)
        * view_args dict modifications made before the FlaskView view is called
          are now available in the FlaskView.
          (Thanks to Philip Schleihauf)

    - Thanks:
        * Thanks to Max Countryman, Julien Rebetez, Philip Schleihauf, and Shuhao Wu

    Version 0.5.1

    - Bugfixes
        * Fixed a bug that caused views that used the @route decorator to
          ignore the subdomain keyword parameter specified in the
          FlaskView's register method.
          (Thanks to Mark Grey for reporting.)

    Version 0.5

    - **Breaking Changes**
        * Changed the way routes are generated to match up with Flask
          documentation. index, post and custom methods without parameters
          are still configured with a trailing slash. put, patch, get,
          delete, and custom methods with parameters are configured without
          a trailing slash now.

        * Changed the way endpoints are generated to accommodate the more
          common cases. Methods with a single route are no longer have
          endpoints suffixed with an index.
          (Thanks to Jesaja Everling for the original patch.)

    - Features
        * Added support for specifying a custom endpoint using an endpoint
          keyword argument in the @route decorator.

    - Bugfixes
        * Fixed a bug that would not allow you to use any parameter name
          but "id" in the special methods.
